# Installing the Burp Suite Certificate as a System Certificate for SSL Pinning Bypass:-

1. **Download Burpsuite Certificate and copy it in your Linux machine.**
2. **Convert Certificate Format:**
- Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the downloaded certificate.
- Run the following command to convert the certificate to PEM format:
```bash
openssl x509 --inform DER -in cacert.der -out Burp.pem
```
- This command converts the certificate from DER format to PEM format and saves it as "Burp.pem".

3. **Generate Hash for Certificate:**
- Run the following command to generate the hash for the certificate:
```bash
openssl x509 -in Burp.pem --subject_hash_old
```
- Copy the hash value that begins with "9a..." This hash will be used as the filename.

4. **Rename Certificate File:**
Rename the "Burp.pem" file to match the hash value obtained in the previous step, appending ".0" to the end. For example:
```bash
cp Burp.pem 9a5ba575.0
```
- This step ensures that the certificate file is correctly recognized by the Android system.

5. **Remount Device via ADB:**
- Remount your Android device or emulator via ADB to enable write access to system partitions:
```bash
adb remount
```

6. **Push Certificate to System Directory:**
- Push the renamed certificate file to the system certificate directory on your Android device:
```bash
adb push 9a5ba575.0 /system/etc/security/cacerts
```
- This command copies the certificate to the system's trusted certificate store, allowing it to be used for SSL communication.


7. **Reboot Device:**
- Reboot your Android device to apply the changes:
```bash
adb reboot
```
- After the reboot, the Burp Suite certificate will be recognized as a trusted system certificate, enabling SSL pinning bypass for applications using SSL/TLS.

#### By following these steps, you can effectively install the Burp Suite certificate as a system certificate on your Android device, facilitating SSL pinning bypass for penetration testing purposes.
